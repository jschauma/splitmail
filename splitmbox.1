.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility splits an mbox-file given on the command-line or via STDIN into
individual mail files.
If no output directory is specified,
.Nm
will create the individual mail files in the current working directory.
Each resulting file is named
.Ar NNNNNN ,
with leading zero-padding.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d Ar dir
If specified, resulting files will be stored in
.Ar dir .
If
.Ar dir
does not exist,
.Nm
will attempt to create it.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by Jan Schaumann
<jschauma@netmeister.org>.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility can only handle mboxes with lines shorter than 1024 characters.
.Pp
If an mbox is provided with more than 999,999 messages, then the resulting
files will not be alphabetically sorted correctly, as filenames for the
next messages are not zero-padded on the left.
